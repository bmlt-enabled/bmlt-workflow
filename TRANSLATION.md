# Translating BMLT Workflow

## Instructions for translators
Translation is a great way to help the BMLT Workflow project in a less technical way, and help us get the plugin to as many people as possible.

Main instructions for translation will be kept here: https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/bmlt-workflow/wiki/Translating-BMLT-Workflow

Short summary:

- fork or clone https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/bmlt-workflow.git
- lang/bmlt-workflow.pot contains the base pot file, with file inclusions, exclusions and paths
- create or edit the .po files for your language with PoEdit or similar tool 
- save your .po file to the lang folder
- create a pull request against the main branch with your updated po file containing translations
- we'll do the rest!
