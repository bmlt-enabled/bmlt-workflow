== Description ==
This plugin was developed for NA Australian Region to support automation of meeting adds/changes/deletes.
It is designed to reduce the current complex and heavy manual processing of forms by both the form submitter and the service body trusted servants.

For trusted servants, there is now one place that you can see submitted requests and action them, without data reentry into the BMLT admin console.

For admins, modification of email templates, service committees and email contact details can now be done in the same place, without complex logic in a form builder.

This initial release is specific to the NA Australian Region use case (particularly the FSO/Starter Kit email) but the code is written such that templates are relatively easy to adjust based on feedback from other regions.

== Installation ==
Copy to wordpress plugins directory
